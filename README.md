# Java Programming Tasks

Welcome to the Java Programming Tasks repository! This collection includes a set of Java programs designed to address various programming challenges and showcase fundamental Java concepts.

## Task 1: Read and Display Integer / Calculate Average

### a) Read and Display Integer
   - **File:** `ReadAndDisplayInteger.java`
   - **Description:**
     This Java program prompts the user to enter an integer, reads the input, and displays the entered integer on the console.

### b) Calculate Average of Floating-Point Numbers
   - **File:** `Integer_and_Calculate_avg.java`
   - **Description:**
     This Java program reads two floating-point numbers from the user, calculates their average, and displays the result on the console with two decimal places.

## Task 2: Basic Calculator

### Basic Calculator
   - **File:** `Integer_and_Calculate_avg.java`
   - **Description:**
     This Java program simulates a basic calculator with functionalities to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /), performs the corresponding operation, and displays the result. The program handles division by zero and invalid operator inputs gracefully.

## Task 3: Happy Number Check

### Happy Number Check
   - **File:** `HappyNumberCheck.java`
   - **Description:**
     This Java program determines if a given number `n` is a happy number. A happy number is defined by the process of replacing the number by the sum of the squares of its digits. The program repeats the process until the number equals 1 or loops endlessly in a cycle. It prints `true` if `n` is a happy number and `false` otherwise.

## Task 4: Separate Odd and Even Elements
   - **File:** `OddEvenSeparation.java`
   - **Description:**
     This Java program takes an array as input from the user, separates odd and even elements into two lists, and displays the results.

   - **Sample Input:**
     ```
     Enter the size of the array: 6
     Enter 6 elements: 10 3 5 12 17 22
     ```

   - **Sample Output:**
     ```
     Original Array: [10, 3, 5, 12, 17, 22]
     Odd Elements: [3, 5, 17]
     Even Elements: [10, 12, 22]
     ```

## Task 5: Compression of String
   - **File:** `StringCompression.java`
   - **Description:**
     This Java program takes a string as input from the user, compresses it by representing consecutive characters with counts, and displays the result.
   - **Sample Input:**
     ```
     Enter a string: AAABBCCCDE
     ```

   - **Sample Output:**
     ```
     Compressed String: A3B2C3DE
     ```

## Task 6: Zigzag Pattern for String

   - **File:** `ZigzagPattern.java`
   - **Description:**
     This Java program takes a string as input from the user and prints a zigzag pattern based on the characters in the string.

   - **Sample Input:**
     ```
     Enter a string: zohocorporationteam
     ```

   - **Sample Output:**
     ```
     z   o   h   o   c   o   r
                                p
                          o
                      r
                   a
                t
         i   o   n   t   e   a   m
     ```
