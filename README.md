# Java Programming Tasks

Welcome to the Java Programming Tasks repository! This collection includes a set of Java programs designed to address various programming challenges and showcase fundamental Java concepts.

## Task 1: Read and Display Integer / Calculate Average

### a) Read and Display Integer
   - **File:** `ReadAndDisplayInteger.java`
   - **Description:**
     This Java program prompts the user to enter an integer, reads the input, and displays the entered integer on the console.

### b) Calculate Average of Floating-Point Numbers
   - **File:** `Integer_and_Calculate_avg.java`
   - **Description:**
     This Java program reads two floating-point numbers from the user, calculates their average, and displays the result on the console with two decimal places.

## Task 2: Basic Calculator

### Basic Calculator
   - **File:** `Integer_and_Calculate_avg.java`
   - **Description:**
     This Java program simulates a basic calculator with functionalities to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /), performs the corresponding operation, and displays the result. The program handles division by zero and invalid operator inputs gracefully.

## Task 3: Happy Number Check

### Happy Number Check
   - **File:** `HappyNumberCheck.java`
   - **Description:**
     This Java program determines if a given number `n` is a happy number. A happy number is defined by the process of replacing the number by the sum of the squares of its digits. The program repeats the process until the number equals 1 or loops endlessly in a cycle. It prints `true` if `n` is a happy number and `false` otherwise.

## How to Run

To compile and run the Java programs, follow these general instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

2. **Navigate to the Program's Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Java_Programming

3. **Compile and Run:**
    ```bash
    javac filename.java
    java filename
